To join: Open a PR that adds your users/{name}.nix file. Once it is accepted,
you will be added as a collaborator.

---

Collaborators: To make quick changes to your users/{name}.nix file, create a
branch with your changes and push it to the repo. It will be auto-merged and
the branch will be deleted for you. The auto-merge will only fail if you made
extra changes to other files, if you changed your GitHub ID, or if your changes
fail to pass checks.

Commit messages: There aren't strict guidelines for commit messages (yet), but
please ensure your commits have messages (talking about you, Scott), and keep
your messages brief.
