---

To join: Open a PR that adds your users/{name}.nix file. Once it is accepted,
you will be added as a collaborator. For help writing your users/{name}.nix,
use existing configs as examples, and refer to the schema in ./options.nix.

---

Collaborators: To make quick changes to your users/{name}.nix file, create a
branch with your changes and push it to the repo. It will be auto-merged and
the branch will be deleted for you. The auto-merge will only fail if you made
extra changes to other files, if you changed your GitHub ID, or if your changes
fail to pass checks.

---

Commit messages: There aren't strict guidelines for commit messages (yet), but
please ensure your commits have messages (talking about you, Scott), and keep
your messages brief.

---

Usage: Import the Flake output .#nixosModules.thots into your NixOS config. Each
user's info will be made available under config.thots.<name>.

---

Library: The Flake output .#lib contains some helper functions for mapping
config.thots to other common configuration options. See ./lib.nix for
documentation and examples.
